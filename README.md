# The-WATT
Arduino based Sous-Vide cooker. (Pronounced soo-vee)

# Features
Low cost, high wattage, easy to operate Sous-Vide with all the features of a $400 cooker, with the added benefit of having some fun building it.

# Rationale
As of writing this, it is the summer after my sophmore year of college studying electrical engineering. What that means to me is that I will be living off campus in an apartment, and losing access to a school meal plan and gaining a strict meal budget. Cooking and eating good food is a hobby of mine, and good cooking reqires good equiptment. A Sous-Vide cooker makes a great addition to my arsenal for a number of reasons -  

1. Ease of cooking with an engineering students schedule. Toss almost any meat/veggie/combo in the cooker and leave it for hours at a time. When hungry, sear meat in a pan for 45 seconds and dinner is served. 

2. Quality of food produced. The Sous-Vide has similar benefits to a crockpot/slow cooker, but with much finer grain control which allows for higher quality end products - especially with meat. A perfect medium rare cut of beef is a snap with a Sous-Vide, and no matter how long you leave it, you wont lose the perfect internal temperature. A crockpot cant keep up.

3. Most importantly, the savings! Eating high quality meat is expensive, a habit that reflects poorly on a savings account. With a Sous-Vide, I can buy large cuts of tougher, flavorful meat (i.e. tri-tip, hanger steak) and turn them into meals that are cheap and taste like a million bucks.

So all in all, a Sous-Vide makes perfect sense. The only problem is, a high wattage, good quality Sous-Vide can cost $150 all the way to $400 dollars (since my original research there have been lower cost units have come out with lower wattages, but still beats those in all but looks) . With some extra time on my hands during the summer, I built the WATT.
